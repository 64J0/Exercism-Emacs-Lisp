the Exercism platform.

** About Emacs Lisp

Disclaimer: I copied the text below from the Exercism page since I found it very
interesting.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Emacs Lisp is the language at the core of Emacs, the iconic text editor that is
at the beginning of the Free Software movement. Emacs is made of more than a
million lines of Emacs Lisp, and all the applications that run inside Emacs
(IDEs for various programming languages, games, planners, etc.) are written in
Emacs Lisp. User preferences are also lists of Emacs Lisp expressions.

Knowing Emacs Lisp is the first step into Lisp, the second oldest programming
language still used (just turned 60 in 2018) and also a language that still
influences so many other programming languages.

* My Emacs

If you'd like to know more about Emacs, consider consulting the ~README.org~ of
the repository with my personal configuration: [[https://github.com/64J0/Emacs-config][link]]. There I list many useful
references, and give some tips regarding this wonderful tool.

** Emacs Lisp Style Guide

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
This Emacs Lisp style guide recommends best practices so that real-world Emacs
Lisp programmers can write code that can be maintained by other real-world Emacs
Lisp programmers.
